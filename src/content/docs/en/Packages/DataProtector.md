title: Data Protector

| [🪄Open on GitHub](https://github.com/achieveonepark/data-protector)

- Provides functionality to compress and encrypt `byte[]` and `string` data before saving it physically, making it harder to inspect the stored data directly.<br>
- For encryption, the user must supply a `16-byte` `string key` value.<br>
- Also provides logic to compare whether a file has changed by extracting a `SHA256` hash value from `byte[]` or `string` data.<br>
