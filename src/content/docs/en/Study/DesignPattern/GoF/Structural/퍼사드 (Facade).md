# Facade

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that wraps a complex subsystem with a simple top-level API to improve usability.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When hiding a game boot sequence behind one method.
- When internal module details should be hidden from the outside.

## Parts (roles)
- Facade
- Subsystem
- Client

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public sealed class GameStartupFacade
{
    private readonly SaveSystem saveSystem = new();
    private readonly AudioSystem audioSystem = new();
    private readonly UiSystem uiSystem = new();

    public void StartGame()
    {
        saveSystem.Load();
        audioSystem.Initialize();
        uiSystem.OpenLobby();
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- It clarifies module boundaries and reduces coupling.
- Features can be extended or integrated without modifying existing code.

## Things to watch out for
- If wrapper layers become too deep, debugging gets harder.
- Interfaces should stay small so responsibility boundaries do not blur.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where complex subsystem calls are simplified into a single entry point.

```d2 title="Facade Flow"
direction: right

client: "Game Bootstrap"
facade: "StartGameFacade"
assets: "AssetLoader"
save: "SaveSystem"
network: "NetworkClient"
result: "Ready To Play"

client -> facade: "StartGame()"
facade -> assets: "load"
facade -> save: "restore"
facade -> network: "connect"
assets -> result
save -> result
network -> result
```
