# Builder

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that separates complex object creation into steps to improve readability and safety.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When creating configuration objects with many options.
- When the same process produces different results.

## Parts (roles)
- Builder
- Director (optional)
- Product

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public sealed class EnemyWaveConfig
{
    public int EnemyCount;
    public float SpawnIntervalSeconds;
    public string RewardId;
}

public sealed class EnemyWaveBuilder
{
    private readonly EnemyWaveConfig waveConfig = new();

    public EnemyWaveBuilder SetEnemyCount(int enemyCount)
    {
        waveConfig.EnemyCount = enemyCount;
        return this;
    }

    public EnemyWaveBuilder SetSpawnInterval(float spawnIntervalSeconds)
    {
        waveConfig.SpawnIntervalSeconds = spawnIntervalSeconds;
        return this;
    }

    public EnemyWaveBuilder SetReward(string rewardId)
    {
        waveConfig.RewardId = rewardId;
        return this;
    }

    public EnemyWaveConfig Build() => waveConfig;
}
```

## Advantages
- Object creation responsibilities are well organized, which makes dependency management easier.
- Creation policies can be changed flexibly by environment or situation.

## Things to watch out for
- Avoid introducing overly abstract creation layers for simple problems.
- As creation rules increase, keeping documentation and tests in sync becomes more important.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where a complex object is assembled step by step and returned at the end.

```d2 title="Builder Flow"
direction: down

director: "Director"
step1: "BuildStats()"
step2: "BuildEquipment()"
step3: "BuildSkills()"
product: "CharacterData"

director -> step1
step1 -> step2
step2 -> step3
step3 -> product
```
