# Prototype

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that creates new objects by cloning an existing prototype instead of calling a constructor.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When creating runtime instances by cloning monster templates.
- When quickly duplicating objects whose creation cost is high.

## Parts (roles)
- Prototype
- Clone
- Prototype Registry

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Game/Enemy Archetype Data")]
public sealed class EnemyArchetypeData : ScriptableObject
{
    public int baseHealth;
    public float moveSpeed;

    public EnemyRuntimeData CloneRuntimeData()
    {
        return new EnemyRuntimeData(baseHealth, moveSpeed);
    }
}

public sealed class EnemyRuntimeData
{
    public int CurrentHealth;
    public float CurrentMoveSpeed;

    public EnemyRuntimeData(int currentHealth, float currentMoveSpeed)
    {
        CurrentHealth = currentHealth;
        CurrentMoveSpeed = currentMoveSpeed;
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Object creation responsibilities are well organized, which makes dependency management easier.
- Creation policies can be changed flexibly by environment or situation.

## Things to watch out for
- Avoid introducing overly abstract creation layers for simple problems.
- As creation rules increase, keeping documentation and tests in sync becomes more important.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where a registered prototype is cloned and then customized with runtime values.

```d2 title="Prototype Flow"
direction: right

spawner: "Spawner"
registry: "Prototype Registry"
prototype: "Enemy Prototype"
clone: "Clone()"
customize: "Set Runtime Values"
result: "Spawned Enemy"

spawner -> registry: "request type"
registry -> prototype
prototype -> clone
clone -> customize
customize -> result
```
