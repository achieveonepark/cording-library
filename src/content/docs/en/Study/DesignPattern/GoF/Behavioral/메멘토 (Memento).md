# Memento

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that saves and restores internal object state as encapsulated snapshots.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When implementing checkpoint rollback.
- When supporting Undo / Redo.

## Parts (roles)
- Originator
- Memento
- Caretaker

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public readonly struct PlayerStateSnapshot
{
    public readonly Vector3 Position;
    public readonly int Health;

    public PlayerStateSnapshot(Vector3 position, int health)
    {
        Position = position;
        Health = health;
    }
}

public sealed class PlayerStateHistory
{
    private readonly Stack<PlayerStateSnapshot> snapshots = new();

    public void Save(PlayerStateSnapshot snapshot) => snapshots.Push(snapshot);
    public bool TryRestore(out PlayerStateSnapshot snapshot) => snapshots.TryPop(out snapshot);
}
```

## Advantages
- State save and restore logic can be isolated without exposing internal details.
- It works well for checkpoint and history-based systems.

## Things to watch out for
- Snapshot data can grow quickly if the state is large.
- If restore timing is not clearly defined, synchronization bugs can occur.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where original state is stored as a snapshot and restored when needed.

direction: right

originator: "Originator"
create: "Create Memento"
caretaker: "Caretaker Stack"
undo: "Undo Request"
restore: "Restore Memento"
state: "Previous State"

originator -> create: "save"
create -> caretaker: "push"
undo -> caretaker: "pop"
caretaker -> restore
restore -> originator
originator -> state
```
