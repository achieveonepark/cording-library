# Strategy

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that encapsulates algorithms with the same goal behind an interface so they can be swapped at runtime.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When AI attack behavior should change by situation.
- When aiming or movement policies differ by character.

## Parts (roles)
- Strategy Interface
- Concrete Strategy
- Context

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public interface IAimStrategy
{
    Vector3 GetAimPosition(Transform shooterTransform, Transform targetTransform);
}

public sealed class DirectAimStrategy : IAimStrategy
{
    public Vector3 GetAimPosition(Transform shooterTransform, Transform targetTransform)
    {
        return targetTransform.position;
    }
}

public sealed class LeadAimStrategy : IAimStrategy
{
    public Vector3 GetAimPosition(Transform shooterTransform, Transform targetTransform)
    {
        return targetTransform.position + targetTransform.forward * 0.5f;
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Behavior is separated into smaller units, which reduces the impact of changes.
- Adding or swapping rules is relatively safe.

## Things to watch out for
- As the number of objects and indirect calls increases, the flow can become harder to follow.
- Ordering bugs should be pinned down with tests.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where a context swaps algorithms through a strategy interface.

```d2 title="Strategy Flow"
direction: right

context: "PathContext"
selector: "Select Strategy"
a_star: "AStarStrategy"
flow_field: "FlowFieldStrategy"
execute: "FindPath()"
result: "Path Result"

context -> selector
selector -> a_star: "small map"
selector -> flow_field: "large crowd"
a_star -> execute
flow_field -> execute
execute -> result
result -> context
```
