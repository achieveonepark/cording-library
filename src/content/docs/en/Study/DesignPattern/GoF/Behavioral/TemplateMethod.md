# Template Method

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern where the overall procedure is fixed, while only the detailed steps are changed in subclasses.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When the skill execution order is the same but the effect differs.
- When common pre-processing and post-processing must be enforced.

## Parts (roles)
- Template Method
- Primitive Operation
- Concrete Class

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public abstract class SkillExecutionTemplate
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        if (!CanExecute())
        {
            return;
        }

        ConsumeCost();
        PlayCastAnimation();
        ApplyEffect();
    }

    protected virtual bool CanExecute() => true;
    protected virtual void ConsumeCost() { }
    protected virtual void PlayCastAnimation() { }
    protected abstract void ApplyEffect();
}

public sealed class HealSkillTemplate : SkillExecutionTemplate
{
    protected override void ApplyEffect()
    {
        // Heal target.
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Behavior is separated into smaller units, which reduces the impact of changes.
- Adding or swapping rules is relatively safe.

## Things to watch out for
- As the number of objects and indirect calls increases, the flow can become harder to follow.
- Ordering bugs should be pinned down with tests.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where the parent fixes the algorithm order and the subclass changes only some steps.

```d2 title="Template Method Flow"
direction: down

template: "AbilityBase.Execute()"
step1: "Validate()"
step2: "ConsumeResource()"
step3: "DoAction() (override)"
step4: "AfterAction()"
result: "Ability Done"

template -> step1
step1 -> step2
step2 -> step3
step3 -> step4
step4 -> result
```
