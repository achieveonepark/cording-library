# State

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that separates behavior by state into objects and swaps behavior based on state transitions.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When player movement and combat states keep increasing.
- When `if-else` state branching becomes too large.

## Parts (roles)
- Context
- State Interface
- Concrete State

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public interface ICharacterState
{
    void Tick(PlayerStateMachine stateMachine);
}

public sealed class IdleState : ICharacterState
{
    public void Tick(PlayerStateMachine stateMachine)
    {
        if (stateMachine.MoveInput > 0f)
        {
            stateMachine.ChangeState(new RunState());
        }
    }
}

public sealed class RunState : ICharacterState
{
    public void Tick(PlayerStateMachine stateMachine)
    {
        if (stateMachine.MoveInput <= 0f)
        {
            stateMachine.ChangeState(new IdleState());
        }
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Behavior is separated into smaller units, which reduces the impact of changes.
- Adding or swapping rules is relatively safe.

## Things to watch out for
- As the number of objects and indirect calls increases, the flow can become harder to follow.
- Ordering bugs should be pinned down with tests.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where the context delegates to the current state object and performs transitions.

```d2 title="State Flow"
direction: right

context: "PlayerContext"
idle: "IdleState"
run: "RunState"
jump: "JumpState"
input: "Input"
output: "Animation / Logic"

input -> context
context -> idle: "delegate"
idle -> run: "move key"
run -> jump: "jump key"
jump -> idle: "landing"
idle -> output
run -> output
jump -> output
```
