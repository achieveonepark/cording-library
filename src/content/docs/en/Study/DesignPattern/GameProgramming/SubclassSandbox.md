# Subclass Sandbox

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern where the parent provides a safe extension API and children are restricted to implementing only within that boundary.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When extending skills or AI while protecting core rules.
- When you want to control designer-facing extension points.

## Parts (roles)
- Base Class: provides a safe API
- Hook: child implementation point
- Subclass: extension implementation

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public abstract class SkillBase
{
    public void ExecuteSkill()
    {
        if (!CanExecute())
        {
            return;
        }

        ConsumeResource();
        PlayCastAnimation();
        ApplyEffect();
    }

    protected virtual bool CanExecute() => true;
    protected virtual void ConsumeResource() { }
    protected virtual void PlayCastAnimation() { }
    protected abstract void ApplyEffect();
}

public sealed class FireballSkill : SkillBase
{
    protected override void ApplyEffect()
    {
        // Spawn fireball projectile.
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Only the API allowed by the parent is exposed, so extension code can be safely constrained.
- It is useful when common rules such as cooldowns or resource costs must be enforced in the base class.

## Things to watch out for
- If the base class grows too large, extension flexibility can actually decrease.
- If hook contracts are unclear, behavior consistency can break between subclasses.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where the parent template enforces common rules and the child implements only the hook.

```d2 title="Subclass Sandbox Flow"
direction: right

caller: "SkillRunner"
base: "SkillBase.Cast()"
validate: "Mana / Cooldown Check"
hook: "DoCast() Hook"
child: "FireballSkill.DoCast"
common: "Apply Global Rule"
result: "Skill Executed"

caller -> base
base -> validate
validate -> hook: "pass"
hook -> child
child -> common
common -> result
validate -> result: "fail -> cancel"
```
