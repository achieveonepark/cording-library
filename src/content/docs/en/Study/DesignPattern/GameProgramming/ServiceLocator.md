# Service Locator

## One-line pattern summary
A pattern that gathers access to shared services into a central registry to reduce coupling at the call site.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When referencing audio, save, or analytics services globally.
- When you want to simplify DI in the early stage of development.

## Parts (roles)
- Service Interface
- Locator Registry
- Bootstrap Registration

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public interface IAudioService
{
    void PlaySfx(string clipId);
}

public static class GameServices
{
    public static IAudioService AudioService { get; private set; }

    public static void RegisterAudioService(IAudioService audioService)
    {
        AudioService = audioService;
    }
}

public sealed class DamageFeedbackSystem
{
    public void OnHit()
    {
        GameServices.AudioService?.PlaySfx("Hit");
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Shared services can be replaced or injected from one place, which speeds up early development.
- Since callers no longer own creation responsibilities, usage code becomes simpler.

## Things to watch out for
- Hidden global dependencies make test isolation and dependency tracking harder.
- If initialization order is wrong, runtime null-reference errors can easily occur.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the flow where the client looks up a service by interface key and uses it.

```d2 title="Service Locator Flow"
direction: right

client: "Gameplay System"
locator: "Service Locator"
registry: "Service Registry"
service: "IAudioService Implementation"
result: "Play SFX"

client -> locator: "Resolve<IAudioService>()"
locator -> registry: "lookup key"
registry -> service: "return instance"
service -> result: "Play(soundId)"
result -> client: "done"
```
