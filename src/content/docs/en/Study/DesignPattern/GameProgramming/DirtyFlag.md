# Dirty Flag

## One-line pattern summary
A lazy update pattern that marks expensive calculations so they are recomputed only when the underlying value changes.

## Typical Unity use cases
- When stat aggregation or layout calculation is expensive.
- When recalculating every frame is unnecessary.

## Parts (roles)
- Primary Data: source data
- Dirty Flag: whether recalculation is needed
- Cache: computed result

## Unity example (C#)
The code below is a simplified Unity example based on the scenario described above.

```csharp
public sealed class PlayerAttackStat
{
    private int baseAttackPower;
    private int equipmentBonusPower;
    private bool needsRecalculation = true;
    private int cachedAttackPower;

    public void SetBaseAttackPower(int value)
    {
        baseAttackPower = value;
        needsRecalculation = true;
    }

    public void SetEquipmentBonusPower(int value)
    {
        equipmentBonusPower = value;
        needsRecalculation = true;
    }

    public int GetFinalAttackPower()
    {
        if (!needsRecalculation)
        {
            return cachedAttackPower;
        }

        cachedAttackPower = baseAttackPower + equipmentBonusPower;
        needsRecalculation = false;
        return cachedAttackPower;
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- It reduces unnecessary work per frame by calculating only when the value actually changes.
- It is especially effective for values that do not change often, such as UI, stats, or transforms.

## Things to watch out for
- If the flag update is missed, bugs appear where stale data is used.
- When dependencies become complex, it becomes difficult to track which change should set the flag.

## Interaction diagram

This shows the lazy update flow where recalculation happens only when a value changes.

```d2 title="Dirty Flag Flow"
direction: right

change_event: "Stat Changed"
mark_dirty: "dirty = true"
render_request: "UI / Combat Query"
check_dirty: "dirty?"
recalc: "Recalculate Cached Value"
reuse: "Use Cached Value"
output: "Final Value"

change_event -> mark_dirty
mark_dirty -> render_request
render_request -> check_dirty
check_dirty -> recalc: "yes"
check_dirty -> reuse: "no"
recalc -> output
reuse -> output
recalc -> reuse: "dirty = false"
```
